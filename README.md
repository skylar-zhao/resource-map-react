## About 
Programmatically display resources from a JSON file based on user-selected filters. Results are displayed both as markers on a map using Leaflet and as a list of results.

## Functions
* Checkbox category filters for different types of resources. Users can select more than one category, and the resources shown will include all of the checked filters.
* Displays resources matching said category filters on a list and as markers on a map.
* Markers can be clicked to display a pop-up containing information about the resource, and the corresponding resource in the list will scroll into view.

## To-dos
* Make the corresponding marker pop-up visible and move the map so that the marker is into view. 
* Make the site responsive using React media queries.
